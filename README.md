Challenge : Cyber Detective

You are a detective who is trying to solve a case. You need to get a hold of one of your suspects whose whereabouts are absolutely unknown. Though, you found the suspect on one of the social media platforms where the person had uploaded pictures and the place where they were taken might be the first clue to get to this person. So using the uploaded images- 

1. Find out where the pictures were taken and

2. Find out the exact coordinates of the place

Steps to find the solutions to the above:
1. Use a reverse image search engine (such as Yandex) to find similar images and try to find the location of the picture.
2. Once you find the location, use Google Earth in street view and try to find similarities between the view and given image.
3. When you find the exact place, you can find the coordinates easily.

And now that you've successfully found out the place, you know where to start your search for the suspect.
